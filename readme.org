# TODO: logo image
# TODO: borges quote

*** TODO Motivation

Org Babel is good for scheduling workloads locally
or remotely via SSH, and the Borges scheduler just takes it 
to the next level by using Mesos to abstract the resources used
for running the workloads as specified in the Org mode document.

*** TODO Usage

**** Using ~curl~

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
curl -X POST -d@jobs.org 127.0.0.1:8888/jobs/
#+END_SRC

**** Using ~borges.el~

- Open an Org mode document
- Set the =#+borgesaddress:= in buffer setting in your document.
- Call ~org-borges-exec~
- Visit the address with the resulting Org mode document.

*** TODO Installation

Just get the binary for your platform.

*** TODO Hacking
